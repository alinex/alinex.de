        <h4>Goals and Usage</h4>
        <p>A lot of the things here are learning projects which I use to increase my knowledge.
          But often they are used for my professional projects later, too.
          My general goal is to make modern web applications and tools for managing them.
          Most of them are open source and free to use.
